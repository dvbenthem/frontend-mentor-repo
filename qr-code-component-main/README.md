# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## 📝Important to Note

Currently, I do not have a Frontend Mentor Pro Account and was not able to download the Figma design files. I did create my own Figma files using the JPG images provided as a guide.
