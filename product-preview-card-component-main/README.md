# Frontend Mentor - Product Preview Card Component Solution

This is my solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## üìùImportant to Note

Currently, I do not have a Frontend Mentor Pro Account and was not able to download the Figma design files. 

Images shown below represent Figma design files I created from scratch using the JPG static design images provided by Frontend Mentor as a guide.

### üöÄ Continued development 

A few areas I plan to continue working on in future Frontend Mentor projects:

- Seek out and build upon project feedback received from the Frontend Mentor and development community
